Embarking my capstone project in the Google Data Analytics course, I'm playing the role of a Junior Analyst for Cyclistic, a Chicago-based company. The main goal is to carefully look at how casual riders and annual members behave, focusing on making annual memberships better.
Motivate International generously provided the data for this analysis, under the [LYFT license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). I'm working on this project to find important insights that can help Cyclistic improve how they offer annual memberships.
